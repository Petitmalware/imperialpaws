    <p>
      At ImperialPaws Pekingese, our adoption process is designed to ensure that
      every puppy is placed into a safe, loving, and well-prepared home.
      Responsible placement is just as important as responsible breeding.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Browse Available Puppies</h2>
    <p>
      Visitors are welcome to explore our available and reserved puppies at any
      time. Each puppy listing includes detailed information, photos, and current
      availability status.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Submit an Adoption Application</h2>
    <p>
      When you find a puppy you are interested in, you may submit an adoption
      application directly from that puppy’s detail page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submitting an application does not guarantee approval. We accept one
      application per puppy to ensure fairness and clarity throughout the process.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Application Review</h2>
    <p>
      Each application is reviewed carefully and individually. We take time to
      understand each prospective family and determine the best possible match
      for the puppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this stage, we may reach out if additional information is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Application Status Updates</h2>
    <p>
      After submitting an application, you will receive a unique tracking code.
      This code allows you to check the status of your application at any time
      through our website.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Placement & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Once a decision has been made, your application status will be updated.
      If approved, we will provide guidance on next steps and preparation for
      welcoming your puppy home.
    </p>

    <p class="closing-note">
      We appreciate your patience throughout this process. Thoughtful placements
      take time, and our priority is always the long-term well-being of our puppies.
