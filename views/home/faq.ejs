    <h2>Why do you require an adoption application?</h2>
    <p>
      The adoption application allows us to ensure that each puppy is placed
      into a safe, prepared, and committed home. Thoughtful placement is essential
      to the long-term well-being of our puppies.
    </p>

    <h2>Does submitting an application guarantee approval?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Submitting an application does not guarantee approval. Each application
      is reviewed individually, and decisions are made based on the best interest
      of the puppy.
    </p>

    <h2>How long does the application review process take?</h2>
    <p>
      Review times may vary depending on the number of applications received.
      We appreciate your patience and ask that applicants allow adequate time
      for careful consideration.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I check the status of my application?</h2>
    <p>
      After submitting an application, you will receive a unique tracking code.
      This code allows you to check your application status at any time through
      our website.
    </p>

    <h2>Do you accept more than one application per puppy?</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain fairness and clarity, we accept one active application per
      puppy at a time.
    </p>

    <h2>Are your puppies vaccinated and vet checked?</h2>
    <p>
      Puppies receive age-appropriate veterinary care and monitoring. Specific
      health details are listed on each puppy’s detail page.
    </p>

    <h2>Do you offer delivery or transportation?</h2>
    <p>
      Transportation options may vary depending on location and circumstances.
      Available options are discussed with approved applicants.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I visit the puppies in person?</h2>
    <p>
      Visit options, if available, are discussed during the adoption process and
      may depend on timing, location, and the puppy’s age.
    </p>

    <h2>Who can I contact if I have additional questions?</h2>
    <p>
      If your question is not answered here, you may reach out through our
      contact page. We are happy to provide additional information when appropriate.
