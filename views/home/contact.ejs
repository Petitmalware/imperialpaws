    <h2>Before Reaching Out</h2>
    <p>
      For questions related to a specific puppy, we kindly encourage visitors
      to review the puppy’s detail page, our adoption process, and our frequently
      asked questions before contacting us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many common questions regarding availability, health care, and placement
      are answered throughout the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Adoption Applications</h2>
    <p>
      If you are interested in a particular puppy, the first step is to submit
      an adoption application directly from that puppy’s detail page.
    </p>

      If you have already submitted an application, you may track the status of
      your application at any time using the tracking code provided after submission.
