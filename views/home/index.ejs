    <h2>Not a Marketplace</h2>

    <p>
      ImperialPaws does not operate as a marketplace or broker. Puppies are not
      placed based on speed, bidding, or payment alone. Each placement is made
      intentionally, with the welfare of the puppy as the primary consideration.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach allows us to maintain consistency, fairness, and long-term
      accountability in every adoption decision.

      Responsible breeding is about more than producing puppies — it is about
      planning, care, and ethical decision-making. Every ImperialPaws puppy
      is raised with long-term well-being in mind.
