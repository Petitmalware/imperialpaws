    <p>
      ImperialPaws is a small, dedicated Pekingese breeding program built on
      responsibility, transparency, and respect for the breed. Our focus is not
      volume — it is quality, care, and thoughtful placement.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      We believe responsible breeding begins long before a puppy is placed.
      Each puppy is raised in a home environment, receives daily care and early
      socialization, and is monitored closely throughout development.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not rush placements or operate on a first-come basis. Our goal is
      to ensure every puppy is placed into a prepared, committed, and loving home.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pekingese?</h2>
    <p>
      Pekingese are loyal, affectionate companions known for their deep bond with
      their families. Their dignified nature and gentle temperament make them
      exceptional household companions when raised and placed responsibly.
    </p>

    <h2>Health & Care</h2>
    <p>
      Puppies receive age-appropriate veterinary care and ongoing monitoring.
      Health information is shared openly with approved applicants, and we are
      always available to answer questions regarding care and expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>Thoughtful Placement</h2>
    <p>
      Placing a puppy is a long-term commitment. Our adoption process exists to
      protect both the puppy and the adopting family. Applications are reviewed
      carefully, and placement decisions are made with the puppy’s well-being as
      the top priority.
    </p>

    <p class="closing-note">
      Our goal is not simply to place puppies — it is to build lasting,
      positive relationships between our puppies and the families who welcome them.
    </p>
